# CPU-Scheduler
CPU Scheduler implemented using OOP and Data Structures.
Project Name: 
CPU Scheduling Problem.
Brief Introduction:
		This project works as “CPU Scheduler”. This project takes different process from the user as input and schedule them according to the selected scheduling algorithm.
Working:
First of all, this project will ask for scheduling algorithm, user has to select one of the. After that, it will ask user to enter total numbers of process. After taking the total number of process, it will ask for the execution time for each process. It might ask for other stuff like priority or time quantum depending on the selected scheduling algorithm. After taking all this stuff, the CPU scheduler will schedule all the process according to the selected scheduling strategy and user will see output on screen.
Instructions:
	Run the submitted code. A menu will appear on the screen that will guide you.
